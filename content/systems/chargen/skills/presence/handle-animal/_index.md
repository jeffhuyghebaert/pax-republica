This skill represents your ability to work with non-sentient creatures of both the domestic and feral variety. It is used when training an animal to behave in a certain way, respond to certain commands, or perform certain tasks. It is also used to calm frightened or nervous creatures, or to establish your dominance over an animal that may otherwise see you as a weaker being. Handle Animal does not reflect your ability to ride mounted beasts, but it will come into play if your mount is uncooperative.
